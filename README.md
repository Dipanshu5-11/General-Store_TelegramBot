# ShoppingSherpa_TelegramBot


This project is a Python script for a Telegram bot that interacts with a Firebase database. The bot is designed to simulate an online store where users can view inventory items, place orders, and receive information about the store.
The script uses the firebase_admin library to authenticate with the Firebase database using a service account JSON key file. Once authenticated, 
it retrieves a reference to the inventory_items and orders nodes in the database.
